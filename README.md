# **Projects**
This is a simple repo containing some projects that I have worked on over time.

## **Javascript Projects:**
  I have made many programs using the p5js framework over the past couple of years. It is very usful as it stores everything on the cloud, allowing for me to work on projects from anywhere, has built in libraries for displaying objects to the screen, and makes it very easy for me to share these projects.
  Some of these I have listed below with a breif description of each. Keep in mind, some of these may be works in progress.

- **[Floyd-Steinberg Dittering](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/amOFDveVF)**
  - My most recent project, uses an algorithm known as Floyd-Steinberg Dithering to reduce the number of colors nessesary to create an image. Here is the Wikipedia page on how this works: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering](url)

- **[Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/P5iHhysxI)**
  - A fun project where various objects collide and, depeding on what one would win according to this chart
  - ![Ultimate RPS](https://github.com/H0wdyW0R1D/Projects/assets/120529450/3612840b-a974-4b6f-81ef-78771621aef7)

- **[Apply color palette to image](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/SNX2U-s9U)**
  - This takes in a list of hex codes (e.g. "#00ff00#ff0da2#000000") and conerts all of the pixels in the given image into the closest color it can find in the palette.

  - This image only uses 16 colors!

- **["Emoji-ify" image](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/6OdDkTztR)**
  - One of my personal favorite projects. This takes in an image and some parameters and converts it into emojis!

  - Here is a grouo photo of FRC Team 5112, the Gongoliers processed using this program.

- **[Spanish Hangman Solver](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/RQmDcPjd2)**
  - This project is an adaptation of my English hangman solver. Passing in the information that you know about the word that is being guessed, it will return the best letter to guess (uses a safe tactic; does not take risks).
  - Input the letters that are known to be in the word, using underscores as blank letters (letters must be lowercase and include accent marks).
  - Letters known to not be in the word are put in the "No es" box (again, all lowercase including accent marks).

- **[Inverse Kinematics Driven Arm](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/RLcySo2Rq)**
  - A simple project that uses simple trigometric functions to interpolate a two-segment robotic are from one point to another.

- **[Maze Generation](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/0fSy73ojM)**
  - Self-explanatory. Generates a maze of varying difficulty depending on what the user inputs.

  - A "simple" *256x256* maze generated using this program.

- **[Maze Solver](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/QwZAYZP1i)**
  - This program uses A* pathfinding in order to find the shortest path between two points in a grid.
  - Click the space bar to display the path.
