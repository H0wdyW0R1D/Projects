# **Projects**
This is a simple repo containing some projects that I have worked on over time.

## **Javascript Projects:**
  I have made many programs using the p5js framework over the past couple of years. It is very usful as it stores everything on the cloud, allowing for me to work on projects from anywhere, has built in libraries for displaying objects to the screen, and makes it very easy for me to share these projects.
  Some of these I have listed below with a breif description of each. Keep in mind, some of these may be works in progress.

- **[Floyd-Steinberg Dittering](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/amOFDveVF)**
  - My most recent project, uses an algorithm known as Floyd-Steinberg Dithering to reduce the number of colors nessesary to create an image. Here is the Wikipedia page on how this works: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering](url)
  
- **[Ultimate Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/P5iHhysxI)**
  - A fun project where various objects collide and, depeding on what one would win according to this chart

- **[Apply color palette to image](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/SNX2U-s9U)**
  - This takes in a list of hex codes (e.g. "#00ff00#ff0da2#000000") and conerts all of the pixels in the given image into the closest color it can find in the palette.
- **["Emoji-ify" image](https://editor.p5js.org/brendandesrosiers26/full/6OdDkTztR)**
  - One of my personal favorite projects. This takes in an image and some parameters and converts it into emojis!
